jQuery Better Param
===================

This jQuery plugin overwrites the default jQuery.param method, extending it to allow nested objects, 
and convert them to be easily passed as parameters over HTTP.

examples:

  $.param({
    "categories": {
      id: 1, 
      name: "Cat1"
    }
  });
  //=> "categories[id]=1&categories[name]=Cat1" (unescaped)
  
  $.param({
    "categories[]": [
      {id: 1, name: "Cat1"},
      {id: 2, name: "Cat2"}
    ]
  }); 
  //=> "categories[][id]=1&categories[][name]=Cat1&categories[][id]=2&categories[][name]=Cat2" (unescaped)


even hugely complex object structures work fine:

  //try this one out...
  $.param({
    "person": {
      name: "Joe Blow", 
      address: "51 Westinghouse Ave", 
      "categories[]": [
        {id: 1, name: "cat1"}, 
        {id: 2, name: "cat2"}
      ]
    }
  });

About this Plugin:
===================

This plugin is meant as a demonstration of a pending patch to jQuery 1.3.3. 
If you like it, review the code and ask @jeresig to integrate it into jQuery 1.3.3.

The code is meant as a drop in replacement of the param: method on jQuery trunk. We will keep it up
to date to support the latest trunk.
